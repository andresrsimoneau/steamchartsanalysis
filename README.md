# Incumbency Role in Presidential Elections

This project also attempts to be politically neutral on its conclusions and to strictly focus on trends and patterns noted. 
## Incumbency Disadvantage 

### Vice Presidenct Incumbancy is a Major Historical Disadvantage

### Approval Ratings Below 45% Are A Death Sentence

## Incumbency Advantage

### Presidential Approval Rating Over 50%
The data assessment of the presidential incumbent results with an approval rating over 50% reveals an undefeated streak of electoral success. 


## Kamala Harris’s Defeat Was Not a Historical Outlier, but following Historical Trends

The data assessment of incumbent results with an approval rating of 45% or below reveals that Harris had the second-smallest popular-vote margin of defeat (1.5 percentage points) among six losing incumbents in this category, only narrowly losing to incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey's margin of defeat (0.7 percentage points) to Richard Nixon in 1968. In addition, with the rare exception of Harry Truman in 1948, no incumbent has ever been able to win an election with an approval rating of 45% or below. This potentially suggests candidate factors are not leading factors for determining presidential elections, but instead, are overshadowed by party approval ratings and other electoral factors such as the economy and inflation. Although Harris and Humphrey had the lowest approval rating and the largest popular-vote margin of defeat of the Vice Presidents, this can largely be attributed to the extraordinary circumstances of both candidates having to replace unpopular incumbent presidents dropping from their respective races (Lyndon Johnson in 1968, Joe Biden in 2024), as most Vice Presidents traditionally run after the incumbent President is term-limited (including candidates before 1948).

Election patterns among incumbent vice presidents further reinforce this trend.  With the exception of George H.W Bush in 1988, most Vice Presidents, even those serving under popular presidencies, tend to lose the Presidential Election. Candidates such as Richard Nixon and Al Gore, despite the strong popularity of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bill Clinton, were unable to win their own respective elections. Out of all of the candidates with an approval rating over 50%, the only losses came from Vice Presidential candidates, while Presidential incumbents went undefeated. This trend also demonstrates Harris' loss following a historical pattern and not as a result of circumstances unique to the candidate. 

Had Harris won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, it would have constituted a significant historical outlier; she would have been the first vice president in U.S. history to win with an approval rating below 45%, and the first incumbent overall to do so in over 75 years, following Harry Truman in 1948 against Thomas Dewey.

## Project Limitations (There R Quite A Few...)

### Not Enough Reliable Data To Compare Incumbents Against Their Opponents, Polling Data Isn't Reliable   

### 1960 and 2000 Elections Had Questionable Outcomes; Strongly Sway Data

Due to the historical grey areas involved in these 2 elections, had the outcomes even marginally changed in the slightest, the data could have produced:

VP Richard Nixon 1960 | 58% approval | 219 EC | WON | PV margin -0.17 pp

VP Kamala Harris 2024 | 41% approval | 226 EC | LOST | PV margin -1.3 pp
```
which tells an entirely different story than the data we currently have... (don't have presidents drop out of the race and have the VP run? lol)
