# Incumbency Role in Presidential Elections

This project also attempts to be politically neutral on its conclusions and to strictly focus on trends and patterns noted. 
## Incumbency Disadvantage 

### Vice Presidenct Incumbancy is a Major Historical Disadvantage

INCUMBENT VICE PRESIDENT RESULTS SINCE 1948
VP Richard Nixon 1960 | 58% approval | 219 EC | LOST
VP Hubert Humphrey 1968 | 42% approval | 191 EC | LOST
VP Al Gore 2000 | 57% approval | 266 EC | LOST
VP Kamala Harris 2024 | 41% approval | 226 EC | LOST
VP George H.W Bush 1988 | 51% approval | 426 EC | WON

### Approval Ratings Below 45% Are A Death Sentence

## Incumbency Advantage

### Presidential Approval Rating Over 50%

## Kamala Harris’ Defeat Was Not a Historical Outlier, but following Historical Trends

The data assessment of incumbent results with an approval rating of 45% or below reveal that Harris had the second lowest margin loss of 1.5 percentage points to Donald Trump out of the 6 losing candidates with an approval rating of 45% or lower, only narrowly losing to incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey's margin loss of 0.7 to Richard Nixon in 1968 (ironically, following the withdrawal of President Lyndon Johnson in the 1968 election). This strongly contests the narrative that Harris was a poor candidate and supports the opposing narrative that Harris had to contend with a difficult electoral environment, given Joe Biden's low approval ratings resulting from electoral frustration over the economy and inflation. 

Had Harris won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, it would have constituted a significant historical outlier; she would have been the first vice president in U.S. history to win with an approval rating below 45%, and the first incumbent overall to do so in over 75 years, following Harry Truman in 1948 against Thomas Dewey.
