INCUMBENT VICE PRESIDENT RESULTS SINCE 1948
VP Richard Nixon 1960 | 58% approval | 219 EC | LOST
VP Hubert Humphrey 1968 | 42% approval | 191 EC | LOST
VP Al Gore 2000 | 57% approval | 266 EC | LOST
VP Kamala Harris 2024 | 41% approval | 226 EC | LOST
VP George H.W Bush 1988 | 51% approval | 426 EC | WON
```


### Approval Ratings Below 45% Are A Death Sentence

## Incumbency Advantage

### Presidential Approval Rating Over 50%

## Kamala Harris' Defeat Was Following Norms, Not Being An Outlier

Had Harris won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, it would have constituted a significant historical outlier as she would have been the first vice president in U.S. history to win with an approval rating below 45%, and the first incumbent overall to do so since Harry Truman in 1948.
