## Incumbency Disadvantage 

### Vice Presidenct Incumbancy is a Major Historical Disadvantage

### Approval Ratings Below 45% Are A Death Sentence

## Incumbency Advantage

### Presidential Approval Rating Over 50%

## Kamala Harris’s Defeat Was Not a Historical Outlier, but following Historical Trends

The data assessment of incumbent results with an approval rating of 45% or below reveals that Harris had the second-smallest popular-vote margin of defeat (1.5 percentage points) among six losing incumbents in this category, only narrowly losing to incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey's margin of defeat (0.7 percentage points) to Richard Nixon in 1968. This suggests candidate factors are not leading factors for determining presidential elections, but instead, are overshadowed by party approval ratings and other electoral factors such as the economy and inflation. 

Election patterns among incumbent vice presidents further reinforce this trend.  With the exception of George H.W Bush in 1988, most Vice Presidents, even those serving under popular presidencies, tend to lose the Presidential Election. Candidates such as Richard Nixon and Al Gore, despite the strong popularity of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bill Clinton, were unable to win their own respective elections. This trend also demonstrates Harris' loss following a historical pattern and not as a result of circumstances unique to the candidate.

Had Harris won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, it would have constituted a significant historical outlier; she would have been the first vice president in U.S. history to win with an approval rating below 45%, and the first incumbent overall to do so in over 75 years, following Harry Truman in 1948 against Thomas Dewey.
